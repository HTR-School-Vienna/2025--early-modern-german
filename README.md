# HTR Winter School 2025 Early Modern German, Autograph Letters of Emperor Leopold I

## Description

This repository contains a selection of digitized autograph letters and their transcriptions of Emperor Leopold I to his Spanish ambassador Johann Maximilian Count Lamberg in the years 1655–1658 and to his Spanish ambassador Franz Eusebius Count Pötting in the years 1662–1667. As Leopold's script is difficult to read, a Transkribus model was created to assist in the transcription.

#### Writing: German kurrent and Latin cursive

## Transcription guidelines

Our transcription tries to follow the original as close as possible. Minor adjustments were made:


I/J and i/j were not differentiated and transcribed as I/i.


u, v, w are transcribed as they appear in the text, if written in German script. If written in Latin script, u/v are transcribed according to modern usage.


If there is an ij/y at the end of a word, it is transcribed as y.


Ligatures like æ are transcribed as ae.


Upper- and lowercase letters are hard to differentiate in Leopold's script; the transcription tries to follow the original as closely as possible. 


Diacritics are not transcribed, except if umlaut-dots are clearly visible.


Punctuation has been modernised in the transcription.


Mistakes in the original are not corrected, but transcribed as they appear.


Additions to the original, such as archival marks or notes by later scribes, are not transcribed. 


Most of the abbreviations that appear in the original are quietly resolved (Example: Eps - Episcopus; MM - Majestäten), some are kept as is (Example: fl.; P., 9bris.)

Some tags were used to further describe the text: Deleted Text, superscript text, unclear, corrected, abbreviations, split words, ciphers, gap, addition. 
In the case of ciphers and some abbreviations, the decrypted or resolved words are part of the tags.
